# K Means Clustering 
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**.<br>
The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.‚Äù

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

**In K Means Clustering Project Notebook**,<br>
Clustered Universities into two groups, Private University and Public University

## Advantages of K Means Clustering
* Ease of Implementation
* High Speed Performance
* Measurable and efficient in Large data collection

## Disadvantages of K Means Clustering
* Selection of optimal number of clusters is difficult
* Selection of initial centroids is random
